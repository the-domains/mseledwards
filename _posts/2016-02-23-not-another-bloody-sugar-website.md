  Joe public might think it's expensive to have your own website. He'd be wrong.
  I've had so many websites over the years, I've literally lost count. (As an
  aside, I started to list them out here but not only did that get incredibly
  dull, I couldn't remember them all so it was also inaccurate.)

# Not another bloody sugar website?!?

Joe public might think it's expensive to have your own website. He'd be wrong. I've had so many websites over the years, I've literally lost count. (As an aside, I started to list them out here but not only did that get incredibly dull, I couldn't remember them all so it was also inaccurate.) 

**How cheap websites are is both a blessing and a curse.**

'Blessing' because it means anyone can put their thoughts out there for the person with the right address to find. 'Curse because' it means anyone can put their thoughts out there for the person with the right address to find.

**So with so much content already out there, why this one?**

Fair question. This one will probably never be read by anyone other than me. (I know, I know, lots of people say that when deep down they want their blog to be the one thing that makes them millions so they can quit their job and move to somewhere warm and sunny!)

But I'm a writer so even when no-one ever reads this, this is still the very best way for me to try this new thing for longer than the small handful of days I managed to stick to it the very last time. Because here's the thing ... I've stopped eating sugar before. Lots of times before.

I know all the science of why it's bad for me. I have lots of stories I could tell you, anecdotal evidence about what it does to me personally. Not to mention the hundreds of sugar-free blogs already out there, each with their stories of transformation.

## But is that enough for me to stop, once and for all?

Honestly? I don't know. I want it to be enough. I want to say "I'm sweet enough" and mean it. I want to ditch this, once and for all. When Easter and Christmas roll round, I don't want chocolate eggs and Santas. I want instead for people to know that they don't bother buying those things for me any more because I won't eat them.

> I choose not to eat sugar because I feel better when I don't.

What's it going to take for that to be true? And, what do I have instead? And, what about alcohol? (Because you can be sure as chips is chips that there is a lot of sugar in my favourite tipple!)

All this and more, to come. Hello and welcome.
